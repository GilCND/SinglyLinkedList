# SinglyLinkedList
# Program developed during my course at NSCC.
## Objective:
### --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Write a C++ program to implement a singly linked list and implement the following functionality:
#### note, the data type the list stores may be chosen to store a data type of your choosing 
#### (int, decimal, another class, etcâ€¦.) . 
#### A method to add an element (Front)
#### A method to append an element (End)
#### A method to insert an element at a specific position.
#### A method to remove an element from a specific position.
#### A method to remove an item based on a supplied value.
#### A method to search for an item by its value and return the index of that item.
#### Implement the class destructor which should delete all of the nodes.
#### Once implemented, create a reference to the new object, add some data from a file and 
#### demonstrate the use of each implemented operation.
